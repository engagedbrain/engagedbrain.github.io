        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>This webpage contains documentation to help students learn how to write as a scientist. It includes guides that span the various outlets that scientific communication takes place. The goal of this page is to be as user friendly as possible, so you'll find documents and resources along with powerpoint presentations for each topic. With this design in mind, that means that the resources can be accessed individually for particular topics, or this webpage and it's resources can also be adapted as a semester long course on Writing in Science or Scientific Publishing. Since the goal of this webpage is teaching, any copy written materials are provided for educational purposes and the copy write stays with the original holder. Anything produced is otherwise available under the creative commons copy write found at the bottom of the website.</p>
        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Writing in the sciences is <i>HARD</i>. Growing up I struggled with writing and gravitated towards the sciences because there seemed to be less writing involved. Advancing through science, all of a sudden writing was everywhere from grants to papers, to abstracts, to posters, a seemingly endless number of writing styles and outlets.

        A Note on References and Resources: Since the goal of this webpage is teaching, any copy written materials are provided for educational purposes and the copyright stays with the original holder. The website as a whole is available under the creative commons copyright found at the bottom of the website. However, everything gathered on this page is inspired by and drawn from other sources. So all that I've done here is simply put resources together on the same page. Further, similar to on-line blogs (see here) references and materials are cited at the end of a page rather than in-text (this style was chosen for ease of writing and reading). Lastly, since this website has been developed over the course of years, some material wasn't documented properly and thus remains not referenced (it would be great to get those references).
