        <h2 id="intro">Cover Letter</h2>
<p>A cover letter is a short, highly-structured letter that is submitted in addition to a résumé or application materials when applying for a job, internship, or academic program.
The cover letter serves several purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, it lets the organization know how you found out about the position</li>
<li>Second, it demonstrates your fit</li>
<li>Third, it lets them know whether you are prepared for the position</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="read">Reading Job Ads</h3>
<p>When reading through the position ad</p>
<ol>
<li>Minimum job requirements
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-bottom: 0;">
<li style="margin-left:2em">If you don't have their minimum qualifications, do not apply</li>
<li style="margin-left:2em">Spend your time wisely by crafting materials for positions which you are qualified<li>
</ol></li>
<li>A caveat - Specific job qualities, characteristics, or skills sets mentioned in the ad
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-bottom: 0;">
<li style="margin-left:2em">These are job-specific lists indicating preferred or desirable qualities or skills</li>
<li style="margin-left:2em">These desirable characteristics are the organization shooting for the stars, if you don’t have these, that’s ok, you can still apply, and if you do have them, you should be moved to the top of the application pile</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Covert qualities, characteristics, or skills indicated in the ad
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-bottom: 0;">
<li style="margin-left:2em">These are "buzzwords" or "read between the line" statements that indicate other qualities the organization is looking for. You can select one or two of these to include in your materials. If the position is using an automated screening system, these words may capture your materials and pass through the first screening. However, make sure that you actually have these things.</li>
</ol></li>
<h3 id="format">Format of a Cover Letter</h3>
<p>Make sure your cover letter is brief, but just long enough to get across exactly what you want to say. Ideally, it should be less than a page or about three to four paragraphs long. See the sample letter below.</p>
<ol>
<li>The first paragraph should state the position you are applying for and where you saw the posting.</li>
<li>The second/third paragraphs should state why you are the person for the job. This is where you really need to sell yourself. It's a good idea to use easy-to-follow bullet points to illustrate your skills and experience. Customize this section to what the company is looking for. Do not include irrelevant information; they know what they are looking for so make it easy on them.</li>
<li>The third paragraph should be a quick, powerful closing. Keep it simple and leave them feeling confident about hiring you.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="tips">Here are some tips for writing an effective cover letter:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Make sure there are no spelling errors or grammar mistakes. Typos and grammar mistakes are immediate grounds for potential employers to throw your application out. Align all text on the left hand margin; you don’t need to indent your paragraphs. Match the font style and formatting of your CV to your cover letter.</li>
<li>Address your reader correctly. If you know the name of your intended reader, use it. Be sure to include your name and contact information (address and e-mail) at the top of the letter with the date below. If you do not know who is going to be receiving your CV, call or e-mail the organization to learn who the letter should be addressed to. Always try to address a specific individual if possible</li>
<li>Research the company before submitting your application and personalize the letter so they know that you understand their unique character. Again, customize your cover letter EVERY time you send it out.</li>
<li>Relate your skills and experiences that are directly related to what their requirements are, but do not go into too much detail; that is what your resume is for. You should look for 2 or 3 specific skills or experiences that make you a good candidate for the position</li>
<li>Be sure all your contact information is on BOTH your CV and cover letter.</p>
