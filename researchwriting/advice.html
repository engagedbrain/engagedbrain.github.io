		<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
		<p><b>Sophomore Year</b></p>
		<p>If you have an inkling that you want to go to grad school and especially if you are thinking about going right after you graduate, you should take your statistics and research methods courses. Also if you have the chance, volunteer to work in a lab. You'll likely not be doing anything glamorous, but you'll start to get into the research environment and understand the quirks of academic research</p>
		<p><b>Junior Year</b></p>
		<p>You should now begin work in earnest in a lab, going through all of the steps of the research process. You'll make a lot of mistakes and you'll likely not find much in your research. But, don't focus on the results, focus on getting the process right. You'll be able to publish with good science, and having a publication is great for an application.</p>
		<p><b>Summer before Senior Year</b></p>
		<p>Begin taking GRE practice tests. You can find free courses online. Make sure to actually do the tests in a situation like you'll be taking the test.</p>
		<p>Research the schools that you want to apply to. Contact the labs that interest you (often times contacting graduate students and post-docs may be more fruitful early, and then contacting PIs once you have more information.)</p>
		<p>Being gathering and preparing your materials (CV, cover letter, statement of purpose)</p>
		<p><b>Senior Year</b></p>
		<p>Revise your materials, get feedback from others and continue a new research project. You'll look to get letters of recommendation starting in August/September and then submitting applications in October/November.</p>
		<p><b>Secret Timeline</b></p>
		<p>The timeline above is pretty general. However, if you are applying to a competitive field or a highly ranked program you will need a close to 4.0GPA, 90+ percentile on all sections of the GRE and if you are applying to a PhD program at least 2 years of research, likely with multiple skills (e.g., programming, statistical analysis, and for biological programs-multiple wetlab techniques), and multiple presentations (and perhaps a paper - or more for top programs). 
		So a more accurate time line follows the above until your senior year when you apply to work as an RA at a top ranked school or program. Then you'll spend 2 - 3 years in that lab gaining skills and making connections before you can either matriculate into the program of your advisor or into the program of a collaborator of your advisor at another top ranked school.</p>
