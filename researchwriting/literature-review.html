        <h2 id="intro">Literature Review</h2>
<p>A literature review is a comprehensive but concise summary of the research on a particular topic. The goal of the review is to integrate and interpretate these primary research articles. Literature reviews may be the most common assignment given in psychological science classes. The purpose of a literature review is to assess a field's collective knowledge and research on a specific topic while also highlighting where further research may need to be conducted. 
Literature reviews should not be a summary of the articles (just like your annotated bibliographies should not be summaries); readers are looking for a critical analysis of recent research on your topic. However, it is understood that it can be difficult to truly interrogate and synthesize information across articles and research studies when you have a limited number of pages and limited view of the field.</p>        
        <h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Start by reading a variety of primary research articles that represent the current state of knowledge on a narrowly defined topic. An easy mistake is to choose a topic that is too broad. When you are first asked to write what seems like a long paper of between 10 and 20 pages, you may try to choose a broad topic. You'll find even with fairly narrowly defined topics or questions that you can find a lot of research. However, you should there is sufficient research evidence on the subject in terms of both quantity of research and diversity of sources. You'll find in some specialized area that there may be only one or two researchers. I tend to stay away from these areas because with out multiple researchers we are likely missing out on different ideas and perspectives.</li>
<li>Your analysis should be organized by key themes, trends, issues, or comparisons that are directly related to your thesis or research question. Again, DO NOT simply provide individual summaries of each article. What are you finding across studies, what is the 10,000 foot view of your topic? Are people asking questions in different ways, can you connect areas that haven't previously been connected, for example, do people talk about the same idea or concept but use different vocabulary?</li>
<li>Emphasize where the present research fits with previous theories and studies. While you are looking towards the most recent literature, you also want to recognize the historical aspect (if its an older topic). Since you are combining articles and topics in new ways, the end of your literature review should identify gaps in the field that will be addressed by the current research (if you are proposing a study) or should be addressed (if you are not carrying out research.</li>
<li>In literature reviews for class, include your own thoughts, evaluations, and questions of the literature.</li>
</ul>
