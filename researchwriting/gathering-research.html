        <h2 id="intro">Gathering Research</h2>
<p>Finding and gathering research is hard. It takes a lot of time. It requires a lot of readings and includes a lot of "failure." You'll find that many articles you think might be helpful are not. You'll probably read or scan 5-10 times as many articles as you actually include in your report.<p>
<h2 id="Choosing a Topic">Choosing a Topic</h2>
<p>Sources of research topics can come from many places</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal interest</li>
<li>Information/Observation</li>
<li>Practical Problems</li>
<li>Fleeting thoughts</li>
<li>Reading</li>
<li>Theories</li>
</ul>
<p>Choosing a topic can be one of the toughest hurdles to get over. Start with something broad and then choose just one particular aspect so your topic is manageable.
e.g., You are interested in how memory works, but that is a huge topic! Possible aspects of this topic are:</p>
<ol><li>How are memories consolidated during sleep?</li>
<li>What can you do to improve working memory?</li>
<li>What are ways declarative memory contributes to other cognitive functions?</li>
</ol>
<p>Start with the general resources below to familiarize yourself with a topic and come up with potential search words.</p>
<h2 id="search strategy">Search Strategy</h2>
<ul>
<li>State your research question</li>
<li>Determine 3 main ideas/related concepts</li>
<li>Enter additional search words (synonyms, variant spellings, other sayings)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Search Shortcuts</h3>
<ol>
<li>AND: cat AND dog will find material with both mentions</li>
<li>OR: cat OR dog will find material with either (or both) of those words</li>
<li>NOT: dog NOT puppy will find material with dog, but not material with puppy</li>
<li>“”: Phrases indicate that words should be searched together</li>
<li>*: Truncation let’s you cast a wide search by truncating your search word and automatically replacing it, e.g., psycholog* will search for psychologist, psychology, psychological, etc.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Databases</h3>
<p>Databases are the main source for journal articles. However, depending on your institutions budget, you'll have access to more or less of these (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/apr/24/harvard-university-journal-publishers-prices" target="_blank">even Harvard libraries can not afford all of the subscriptions requested</a>)</p>
<h4>Traditional Library Databases</h4>
<p>PsychInfo (Requires a library subscription)</p>
<p>Web Of Science (Requires a library subscription)</p>
<p>Interlibrary Loan (ILL) For may older articles, you may need to plan ahead and request the article through ILL</p>
<h4>Open Source Databases</h4>

<h4>Peer Reviewed Journal vs "Peer-Reviewed Journals"</h4>
<p>Evaluating the authority, accuracy, reliability, coverage and objectivity of journals can be very difficult. Peer-Reviewed Science journals are usually a short-hand for quality information. However, there is a hierarchy of journals and some "science journals" that are no better than type-set blogs. Below are some ways to evaluate journals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Check the impact factor - The impact factor (IF) is the most widely recognized method for attempting to gauge a journal's rank/importance. It is calculated by dividing the number of citations over the previous two years by the number of articles published by that journal. The higher the IF, the more citations (impact) each article from the journal has (especially when keeping in mind that close to 50% of all articles aren't even read). A few 
things to keep in mind: 1. IF is limited to the indexing of citations. 2. IF citation says nothing about the quality or validity of the references themselves. 3.Journals that publish more "review articles" likely have higher IFs. 4. Newer journals take time to be added to the list</li>
<li>Peer-Review - In order for a journal to be considered acceptable as a scholarly publication, it must have a peer review or referee process whereby papers submitted for consideration are read by at least two scholars knowledgeable about the paper's topic. Reviewers provide advice/feedback/criticism to the authors and advice to and editor about whether to accept, reject or suggest some level of revision.</li>
<li>Altmetrics - Altmetrics are based on social web and explore the social readership, diffusion and reuse of articles on blogs, social media and reference management services. You can read more at the <a href="http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/" target="_blank">Altmetric Manifesto</a></li>
<li>Acceptance / Rejection Rates - Acceptance rates for journals, like those for college, may provide some insight into quality.</li>
<li>Open Access Journals (OA) - OA journals are a major boon for the distribution of knowledge. However, they have also been met with some challenges. A myth about OA is that they are not peer-reviewed and of low quality. While some OA journals are predatory (meaning that they solicit articles just so that they can charge Article Processing Charges (APC) and then don't peer-review the article. You can find a list of those journals <a href="advice/feedback/criticism" target="_blank">here</a>. You should treat those journals not as "peer-reviewed science journals" but instead like a blog.
 We see though that these journals are becoming more <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/predatory-journals-recruit-fake-editor-1.21662" target=_blank">tricky</a>. A number of stings in which scientists have submitted terrible research has demonstrated the predatory nature of some of these journals (<a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/60" target="_blank">Science Article here</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4334012/" target="_blank">Review of Science Sting</a>, <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/2017/07/22/predatory-journals-star-wars-sting/" target="_blank">Midichlorian Sting</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preprint Servers</h4>
<p>Public preprint servers (often called archives) allow authors to make manuscripts publicly available before, or in parallel to, submitting them to journals for traditional peer review. This allows for the quick dissemination of work as well as quick feedback from the scientific public. The first and best known preprint server is <a href="https://arxiv.org/" target="_blank">arXiv</a>, but has recently expanded to include other discipline specific servers like <a href="http://www.biorxiv.org/" target="_blank">bioarXiv</a>, <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv" target="_blank">psyarXiv</a>, and <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/" target="_blank">PeerJ</a> among others.
 Many are making the case for <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001563" target="_blank">preprints</a> especially with issues surrounding <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2015/sep/07/peer-review-preprints-speed-science-journals" target="_blank">publishing</a>. Time will tell if the academy will respect these forms of communication if they provide the <a href="http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/07/11/022368" target="_blank">benefits</a> that many suggest.</p>
<h2 id="internet">Internet Resources</h2>
<p>A quick note on internet resources. The internet is great, perhaps one of the most amazing interventions created by humankind. But, as Ben Parker says, "with great power comes great responsibility". It's easy to misuse the internet.</p> 
<h4>As with much of our cognition, it is biased</h4>
<p>It is easy to find yourself only searching in particular ways. This can lead you to only finding a small amount of research that is helpful to you.</p>
<h4>Wikipedia</h4>
<p>An amazing resource and often first stop on the research train line. However, as a secondary resource, you need to leave <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> and go to the primary resources cited. Yes, USE Wikipedia, but only as a connection to other things, it should not be a resource in your writing.</p>
<h4>Internet Sites</h4>
<p>Using a search engine like google isn't the best way to find academic discourse. This means that when you search for "effects of chronic cannabis use in adolescents on working memory and executive function" you'll see things like:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.yellowbrickprogram.com/ArticlePDF/EffectsofChronicHeavyCannabisUseonExecutiveFunctions.pdf" target="_blank">Yellow Brick Program</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.safeandsmartpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Cognitive-Harms-of-Heavy-MJ-authored-and-submitted-by-T-Cermak-MD-in-hi....pdf" target="_blank">Safe and Smart Policy</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.idmu.co.uk/cannabis-memory.htm" target="_blank">Independent Drug Monitoring Unit</a></p>
<p>One links to an academic paper, one links to a report submitted to a governmental agency and a third looks to be a report with a number of citations, but my search was fairly specific. Using a term like "cannabis and memory" or other less specific terms would likely return a number of pseudo-scientific non-profit, quasi-governmental websites. 
While non-profits and governmental white papers and even commercial websites can include a lot of good information, they are again usually secondary sources, and their quality is fairly dramatic. Just as a few bad apples spoil the bunch, a few bad websites means you should not include them in your report. They may be helpful in aiding your understanding 
and to finding other resources, but they are not the support you include in your projects.</p>
<h4>Newspapers, Magazines and Pseudo-academic Writing</h4>
<p>Newspapers, magazines and other places where people write about things can again seem to be very useful resources, but just as with websites above, these can be used to help you in your understanding, but should not be used in your evidence or research. They may be useful for anecdotes or examples, but not much else. Think about the purpose of these writings, generally it is to entertain. So think about these questions when reading things on-line:</p>
<ol>
<li>Authority - who is the author and what are their qualifications?</li>
<li>Affiliation - who pays for this website, content. Is it a government, a non-profit, a PAC, a special interest group? Think about who has sponsored the research and if you need to find other views.</li>
<li>Date - when was this written? Is it up-to-date? How fast is the field that you're studying changing?</li>
<li>Content Accuracy - what are they using for citations, do they point you to other resources? Ask these same questions when you get to the resources? Do you see any blatant errors?</li>
<li>Content Reliability - Are their grammatical or other language issues? Does there seem to be a tone or point of view that is heavily biased? Who does the author seem to be writing for?</li>
<li>Coverage - Does the resources provide an in-depth review of the topic or is it superficial and broad?</li>
<li>Objectivity - Is the material factual, unbiased and in depth? Do you detect any kind of "spin"</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="evalproblem">Evaluate the Problem</h2>
<ul>
<li>Effectiveness (can I find an answer?)</li>
<li>Significance (what is the need or importance?)</li>
<li>Originality (has this already been done?)</li>
<li>Feasibility (Am I competent, can I get access to data, how much cost is there, how much time will it take, what are the difficulties?)</li>
</ul>
