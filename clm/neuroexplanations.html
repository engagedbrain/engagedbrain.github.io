They then had to judge what percentage of other people would know those facts. Researchers found that the subjects responded differently about other people’s knowledge of a fact when the subjects themselves knew that fact. If the subjects did know a fact, they said that an inaccurately large percentage of others would know it too. For example, if a subject already knew that Hartford was the capital of Connecticut, that subject might say that 80% of people would know this, even though the correct answer is 50%. The researchers call this finding “the curse of knowledge.”</p>

      <div class="panel-body"><p>(2) Subjects read a fact about a type of bird (for example, “All sparrows have livers”) and had to decide whether this fact was true of all birds. For half of the facts, the birds used were stereotypical members of the category (sparrows, robins), and the birds were more rare for the other half of the facts (peacocks, penguins). The researchers found that subjects were more likely to answer correctly when the facts used stereotypical birds than when the facts used rare birds, even though logically there should be no difference. They replicated this effect with other kinds of animals, such as mammals and reptiles. They conclude that people are better at reasoning about stereotypical animals than rare animals. </p>

3. Researchers determined that people perform this way by examining the patterns of activation in subjects’ brains as they performed this task.

      <div class="panel-body"><p>(3) Babies were seated on their mothers’ laps in front of a stage. Researchers used a camera to track where the babies were looking. The babies saw a hand reach out and place one doll on the stage. Then a screen was raised, hiding the doll. A hand reached out again and placed a second doll on the stage, out of sight behind the screen. Then the screen dropped. In some cases, there were two dolls on the stage, as there should be, and in some cases there was only one doll. The researchers found that the babies looked much longer at the stage when there was only one doll than when there were two dolls. This looking-time difference between one doll and two dolls lead the researchers to conclude that babies can calculate 1 + 1 = 2. </p> 
      <ul>
      <li>1. The researchers claim this happens because the babies had formed an expectation about how many dolls there should be on the stage. The babies knew there should be two dolls, and their surprise at seeing only one led to their looking longer. </li>

	  <li>2. The researchers claim this happens because the amount of time the babies spent looking at the stage is directly proportional to how much they liked the display. The researchers used this timing data to calculate babies’ preference for the single doll. </li>

    <div id="collapse4" class="panel-collapse collapse">
      <div class="panel-body"><p>(4) Subjects watched two short videos involving a pair of animated balls. In one 
video, the balls moved randomly around the screen. In the other video, one ball appeared to chase the other around the screen. The researchers analyzed subjects’ descriptions of the two videos. They found that the subjects couldn’t stop referring to intentions, desires, and goals in their descriptions of the “chasing” video. The subjects used different types of words, usually related to motion, when describing the other video. The researchers conclude that people think about goal-directed action differently than random action. 
</p> 
      <ul>
      <li>1. Researchers claim that this difference occurs because, when people see motion that appears to be goal-directed, they automatically attribute beliefs and desires to the object performing that motion, even if they know that it’s been programmed to move that way. </li>
<label>1</label><p><input type="number" name="4-1" id="4-1" min="-3" max="3"></p>
<li>2. Researchers claim that this difference occurs because one video was explicitly programmed to look like the balls were chasing each other, and this encouraged the subjects to describe these balls as behaving differently from the balls in the random- motion video.

      <div class="panel-body"><p>(6) A group of three-year-old children participated in this task. They were shown a set of five objects, four of which were familiar to them and one of which was new.

The children reliably pointed to the novel object and not to any of the familiar objects.</p> 
      <ul>
      <li>1. The researchers claim that children applied the new name to the unfamiliar object because children assume that a single object can have only one name. All of the other objects already had names, so they applied the word “blicket” to the new object.

But when the houses were presented close together in the sequence, subjects failed to press the button for the second house. The researchers call this phenomenon “attentional blink.” </p>

The results showed a different cognitive pattern when they weren’t thinking about God. </p>
